        <p>This is my dog, Zoey. She is a pure bred great dane and just over 3 years old. We first met on my birthday in June in 2016, and she's been by my side ever since!</p>
        <ul class="activities">Some of her favorite things include:
          <li>Going for walks with Charlie</li>
          <li>Chasing Pepper and June around the house (her cat siblings)</li>
          <li>Blowing off energy at the dog park and acting a fool</li>
          <li>Being lazy and sleeping on the couch</li>
